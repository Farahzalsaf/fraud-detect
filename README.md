Algorithms like Regression and Gradient Boosting algorithms along with practicing
more Exploratory Data Analysis techniques and developing your ML intuition.

Description:
The Tunisian Company of Electricity and Gas (STEG) is a public and a
non-administrative company, it is responsible for delivering electricity and gas across
Tunisia. The company suffered tremendous losses in the order of 200 million Tunisian
Dinars due to fraudulent manipulations of meters by consumers.
Using the client’s billing history, the aim of the challenge is to detect and recognize
